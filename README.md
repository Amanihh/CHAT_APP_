PORT=3001
JWT_KEY=your_jwt_secret
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_url
```

# Cloudinary Credentials
```env
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_key

💻 Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder and install dependencies:

```

💾 File Upload – Cloudinary Setup
All file uploads (e.g., profile pictures, chat media) are handled using Cloudinary.

```env
CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
